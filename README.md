## 👋 Hey, I’m Imad

🎨 Front-end developer who enjoys turning ideas into clean, interactive interfaces

💻 Working mainly with JavaScript, HTML, and Tailwind CSS

🎮 Gamer, tech nerd, and someone who genuinely enjoys learning how things work (and why they break)

I like building projects with strong visuals, smooth UX, and logic that actually makes sense.
Most of my learning happens by experimenting, failing fast, and refining until it feels right.

Currently focused on improving my front-end skills, building real projects, and pushing myself one commit at a time 🚀
